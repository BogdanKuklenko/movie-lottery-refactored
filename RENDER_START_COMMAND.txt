CRITICAL: Update Render.com Start Command
==========================================

Your gunicorn_config.py is not being loaded!

Go to your Render.com dashboard:
1. Open your web service
2. Go to "Settings"
3. Find "Start Command"
4. Change it to:

gunicorn --config gunicorn_config.py "movie_lottery:create_app()"

Or use the short form:

gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py "movie_lottery:create_app()"

Save and redeploy.

This will load the config file with:
- timeout = 300 seconds (instead of default 30)
- workers = 1
- Other memory optimizations

Without this, ALL the changes in gunicorn_config.py are being IGNORED!
