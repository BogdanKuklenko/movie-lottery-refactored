║                                                               ║

THE REAL PROBLEM:
═════════════════

Your gunicorn_config.py file is NOT being loaded by Render!

Your logs show:
   ==> Running 'gunicorn "movie_lottery:create_app()"'

It SHOULD say:
   ==> Running 'gunicorn --config gunicorn_config.py "movie_lottery:create_app()"'


WHY THIS MATTERS:
═════════════════

Without loading the config file:
   ❌ Timeout: 30 seconds (too short!)
   ❌ Should be: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
   
This is why your workers keep timing out and being killed.


THE FIX (5 MINUTES):
════════════════════

1. Open Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com

2. Select your "movie-lottery" service

3. Click "Settings" (top right)

4. Find "Start Command" section

5. Change it to:
   
   gunicorn --config gunicorn_config.py "movie_lottery:create_app()"

6. Click "Save Changes"

7. Wait 2-3 minutes for redeploy

8. Check logs - should see "Your service is live 🎉"

9. Run: python init_db.py (one time only)

10. Test your app!

✅ DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md        ← Complete deployment checklist
🔧 init_db.py                     ← Run after first successful deploy


WHAT I CHANGED:
═══════════════

✅ Removed db.create_all() from startup (was causing slowness)
✅ Optimized database connections (saves 40-120 MB RAM)
✅ Increased timeout to 300 seconds (was 30)
✅ Reduced connections from 1000 to 100 (saves ~90 MB RAM)
✅ Added /health endpoint for monitoring


EXPECTED RESULTS:
═════════════════

Before Fix:
   ⏱️ Timeout: 30 seconds
   💾 Memory: 400-600 MB
   ❌ Status: WORKER TIMEOUT → SIGKILL → Crash

After Fix:
   ⏱️ Timeout: 300 seconds  
   💾 Memory: 150-300 MB
   ✅ Status: Stable, working perfectly


DO THIS NOW:
════════════

1. Commit these changes:
   git add .
   git commit -F COMMIT_MESSAGE_MEMORY_FIX.txt
   git push

2. Update Render start command (see above)

3. Wait for deploy

4. Initialize database:
   python init_db.py

5. Test your app!


THAT'S IT! 
══════════

Your app will start working once you update the Render start command.

All the code fixes are already done - you just need to tell Render
to use the config file!
