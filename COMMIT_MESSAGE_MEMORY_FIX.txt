Critical Fix: Resolve Memory & Timeout Issues on Render + Diagnostics

Fixed severe production issues causing worker timeouts and OOM kills:

Core Fixes:
- Remove db.create_all() from app initialization (was causing slow startup)
- Optimize SQLAlchemy connection pool (pool_size=1, max_overflow=0)
- Increase gunicorn timeout to 300s for slow free-tier startup
- Reduce worker_connections from 1000 to 100 (memory optimization)
- Reduce max_requests from 1000 to 500 (more frequent worker recycling)
- Add /health endpoint for Render monitoring

Diagnostic Tools (NEW):
- Added diagnostic_middleware.py - automatic startup profiling on Render
- Added diagnostic_startup.py - local testing script
- Integrated checkpoints throughout create_app() to track performance
- Logs show time and memory usage for each initialization step
- Added psutil dependency for memory tracking

Impact:
- Expected memory usage: 150-250 MB (down from 400-600 MB)
- Expected startup time: 10-15 seconds (was timing out at 30-60s)
- Prevents worker OOM kills on resource-constrained environments
- Diagnostic logs will show exact bottleneck if issues persist

Breaking Change:
- Database tables are no longer auto-created on startup
- Run 'python init_db.py' once after deployment to initialize DB

Action Required After Deployment:
- Update Render start command to: gunicorn --config gunicorn_config.py "movie_lottery:create_app()"
- Initialize database using: python init_db.py
- Check logs for [DIAGNOSTIC] lines to see startup performance

Diagnostic logs will show:
[DIAGNOSTIC] [OK] SQLAlchemy initialized | 0.45s | 68.9 MB | +23.7 MB
